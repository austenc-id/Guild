      <section class="content">
        After being born in Boise, Idaho <b>(208)</b> in 1994; to say that I
        moved around a lot would be an understatement. I could go into detail
        about every city I've lived in, but honestly no one has that kind of
        time. I went to 5 elementary schools before I made it to the 5th grade.
        (That should give you a good idea of what I'm talking about here.) At
        that point my mom married my step-father (but I just call him "Dad"), a
        marine, and ironically things settled down, well... kind of. I went to 2
        more elementary schools and 1 middle school to finish off my primary
        education. Then 3 high schools to round everything out. Finally
        graduating from James Campbell High School, Ewa Beach, Hawai'i
        <b>(808)</b> in 2012. After a few years bouncing around for college,
        employment, and binge-drinking opportunities; I finally decided it was
        time to come home. So I packed up and and returned to Boise in the
        summer of 2016 and I've been here ever since... well... kind of.
